In the dark the old man could feel the morning coming and as he rowed he heard the trembling sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made as they soared away in the darkness.

阒黑里，老人感到白天正缓步接近。他一边划船，一边听着飞鱼离开水面时大海颤抖的声音，以及它们坚硬的翅膀在黑暗夜空中翱翔时发出的咻咻声。

He was very fond of flying fish as they were his principal friends on the ocean.
他钟爱这些飞鱼，它们是他在大海里主要的朋友。

He was sorry for the birds, especially the small delicate dark terns that were always flying and looking and almost never finding.
他替鸟儿难过，尤其是对于那些娇小又漂亮的黑燕鸥，它们总是在飞来飞去，不停地寻寻觅觅，却又总是一无所获。
